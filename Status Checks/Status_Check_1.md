# Status Check 1 - February 29th, 2024.

## Which parts of the project have you begun constructing to get to the final working solution?

### None yet, besides general layouts of the design.

## Have you ordered all additional parts that will be needed?  When will they arrive if they have not already?

### No parts have been ordered yet. We have decided which parts we need.

## Have you designed any of the parts that will need to be manufactured?  If not, when will those designs be done?

### We have not. These designs should be done in about a month or so. It is mostly a factor of measuring what all we will impliment and designing systems to hold the different parts in place.

## If you are able to complete the project by May 13th to your expectations, will you receive full credit in all five functional element categories (list how you meet each requirement)?

### At least 4/5. 
### Output Display is composed of a TFT LCD Screen,
### Manual User Input is composed of 2 input buttons, and an on/off switch.
### We have no automatic sensors, as the game is mostly user-input driven. In the future if it is required, it may use distance sensors to enforce a new rule of playing.
### Actuators (none in this case, Mechanisms & Hardware is composed of a mostly 3-D printed base interface, with lock in place mechanisms for certain pieces (who knows, maybe even a scoreboard) and will have holes to screw in parts and ensure they are kept in place. We are trying to go for a very sleek design that is compact but also looks nice. Kinda like  a Nintendo 3Ds.
### Logic, Processing, and Control; AND Miscellaneous wise, we are using an Arduino for programming the software that drives the game. We may use a MP3 reader along with speakers, which primarily use .wav files because of how they are encrypted. The MP3 reader is another solution if it does not work. 

## What are the three most significant design challenges you foresee for this project?

### 3D design and printing. We are still both beginners with CAD software. It may take some extra costs to buy more filament for our project. 
### Programming. Huge issues is that we are working with parts we haven't even seen in real life. These other parts should not be too difficult but may prove to be a challenge.
### Wiring. We are not the best with wiring things up either and will definitely double check every single wire. I would be surprised if we don't short circuit anything a couple times.
