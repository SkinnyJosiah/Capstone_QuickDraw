# Discuss any resources you have used to get your project to this point. 

## We have soldered and set up our TFT-LCD screen for usage. As of now, it is not programmed to do anything but we have the libraries we require for the project. 

## We have also added our current state of [code,](https://github.com/SkinnyJosiah/Capstone_QuickDraw/blob/main/Arduino%20Code/QuickDraw.ino) our [Shield Test](https://github.com/SkinnyJosiah/Capstone_QuickDraw/blob/main/Arduino%20Code/shieldtest.ino) and a [useful page for resources](https://github.com/SkinnyJosiah/Capstone_QuickDraw/blob/main/Workarounds.md) to use when we need them and that pesky GoGuardian blocks them.

# Which parts still need to be ordered/manufactured? 

## Speaker(s), 90 Degree pin headers, power switch.

## Otherwise, the only possible parts we can think of is something to help potentially organize and extend our wiring. Everything else boils down to designing, printing, etc.

# You will demonstrate at least two functional elements that work although do not need to be integrated into the larger system.

## Being able to press the buttons and the Arduino turns on!!

## Just kidding. Out 2 main takeaways from our Sheild-St7735 testing (the model of screen we have) is that we are able to print text and display images.
