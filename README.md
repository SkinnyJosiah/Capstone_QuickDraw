# Quick Draw! 

### [Original Inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0CMZ2H_uWk&pp=ygUVMSwyIHN3aXRjaCBxdWljayBkcmF3)

### Beat your enemies to the queue, but don't jump the gun!

### **Quick Draw is a game where you follow queues to fire. The game will have different sound queues to throw users off, such as any other word that starts with F.**

**Here's a run-down of the rules.**
1. Two players start the game with their hands above the buttons. Randomly, different sound queues will play.
2. Upon each sound queue, a time-reliant function will activate. During this margin of time, the function will track if the user hits the button.
3. If the button(s) is/are hit during this time, the first button that was hit will be tracked.
4. If the sound queue, "FIRE" was played, then the player that hit the button wins that round.
5. Players will have a total of 3 lives to "bring suspense" into the game. Once a player drains the opponent's 3 lives, they win the game.

**What if a player presses a button on an incorrect sound queue other than, "Fire" ?**
- That player will lose their next turn, unable to press their button on the next sound queue.
