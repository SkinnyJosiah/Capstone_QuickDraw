# Discuss any resources you have used to get your project to this point. 

## We have soldered and set up our TFT-LCD screen for usage. As of now, it is not programmed to do anything but we have the libraries we require for the project. 

## We have also added our current state of [code](https://github.com/SkinnyJosiah/Capstone_QuickDraw/blob/main/QuickDraw.ino) and a [useful page for resources](https://github.com/SkinnyJosiah/Capstone_QuickDraw/blob/main/Workarounds.md) to use when we need them and that pesky GoGuardian blocks them.

# Which parts still need to be ordered/manufactured? 

## Speaker(s).

## Otherwise, the only possible parts we can think of is something to help potentially organize and extend our wiring, and a power on/off switch. Everything else boils down to designing, printing, etc.

# You will demonstrate at least two functional elements that work although do not need to be integrated into the larger system.

## Screen turning on and (you won't believe this) the buttons on a breadboard!!
