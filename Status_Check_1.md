# Status Check 1 - February 29th, 2024.

### Which parts of the project have you begun constructing to get to the final working solution?

## None yet, besides general layouts of the design.

### Have you ordered all additional parts that will be needed?  When will they arrive if they have not already?

## No parts have been ordered yet. We have decided which parts we need.

### Have you designed any of the parts that will need to be manufactured?  If not, when will those designs be done?

## We have not. These designs should be done in about a month or so. It is mostly a factor of measuring what all we will impliment and designing systems to hold the different parts in place.

### If you are able to complete the project by May 13th to your expectations, will you receive full credit in all five functional element categories (list how you meet each requirement)?

## At least 4/5. 

## Output Display is composed of a TFT LED

What are the three most significant design challenges you foresee for this project?
